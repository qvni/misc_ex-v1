1> Wizard Spells

/////////////////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////////BEGIN WIZARD SPELLS
/////////////////////////////////////////

Invisibility 
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: Touch 
Duration: Lv1-8: 1 turn. Lv9-14: 2 turns. Lv 15: 2 turns + 5 rounds.
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around <PRO_HIMHER>, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on <PRO_HIMHER>self and fellow party members. And if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Luck
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Range: 15 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains extraordinary luck for the next turn, receiving a +1 bonus to <PRO_HISHER> attack rolls, and minimum damage/healing rolls as well as +10% to all thieving skills. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage are reduced by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and a flaming long sword that deals 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d3 fire damage will deal 1d8+2 slashing plus 2 fire damage instead.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Stinking Cloud changed to Noxious Cloud, save is no longer +2 bonus penalty and is now 0.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Haste

Movement speed bonus nerfed to 150% from 200%, otherwise left unchanged.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Invisibility, 10' Radius
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Lv1-8: 5 rounds. Lv9-14: 1 turn. Level 15: 1 turn, 5 rounds.
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes all creatures within 10 ft. of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature(s) are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature(s) detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature(s) or their gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature(s) become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature(s). The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, or until the recipient attacks any creature. The invisible being(s) cannot open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc. If they attack, they immediately become visible, although the invisibility enables them to attack first.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Ice Storm
Level: 4
School: Evocation
Range: Long
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: -4

When this spell is cast, great magical hailstones pound down for 4 rounds within a 30 foot radius of a point selected by the caster. Creatures within the area of effect have their movement speed reduced by 50%(-4 save vs. spell), and receive 2d8 points of cold damage for each round they remain inside the storm.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Improved Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: Lv1+ 1 turn, Lv9+ 1t+2rounds, Lv15+ 1t+4r.
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen. However, telltale traces—a shimmering—allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.

Note: After making an attack, the wizard is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the wizard.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Otiluke's Resilient Sphere
Level: 4
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell negates

When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature if it fails to successfully save vs. spell at a -3 penalty. The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage. Actually, the only method of removing the sphere is a successful dispel magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world.

The caster has the option of using the spell to protect her allies. Resistances and saving throws are bypassed when the target is willing.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Mislead
Level: 6
School: Illusion
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from his original position. Meanwhile an exact image of the caster is created where he used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster. The illusory double vanishes after 6 rounds and cannot perform any actions at all, like attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage. As long as the image isn't destroyed, the caster can attack and cast spells while remaining completely hidden. The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by a dispel magic or a spell that destroys illusions such as True Seeing.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Disintegrate
Level: 6
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell partial

Upon casting this spell at another creature, a thin green ray shoots unerringly from the caster's fingertip toward the target. Upon contact, the creature must make a saving throw vs. spell at -2 or suffer 3d6 points of magic damage per 2 caster levels (to a maximum of 31d6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Mordenkainen's Sword
(Evocation)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force. The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and deals 5d4 points of damage upon hitting a target. Once the spell is cast, the sword will float in the air completely under the caster's control. This does not prevent the caster from doing any other actions during the spell's duration.

This summon is nearly impervious to all damage.
Slashing:95%
Crushing:95%
Piercing:95%
Missle:95%
Fire:100%
Cold:100%
Electricity:100%
Acid:100%
Magic:0%

-----------------------------------------------------------

Revitalize (Replaces Stone to Flesh)
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: 50 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell will return any creature that has been turned to stone back to flesh. All possessions on the creature likewise return to normal. In addition it removes the effects of feeblemindedness. The effect is instantaneous and there are no Saving Throw checks required.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Sphere of Chaos
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

All enemies within the area of effect must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell every round that they remain in the sphere. If the Saving Throw is failed, one of the following random effects occurs:
 – target is polymorphed into a squirrel
 – target confused
 – target bursts into flames
 – target is paralyzed
 – target is disintegrated
 – target is healed 20 Hit Points
 – target is randomly teleported
 – target is rendered unconscious
 – target is hasted
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
 Mass Invisibility 
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: 1 turn.
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius 
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes all friendly creatures within the area of effect to be affected by the spell Improved Invisibility. This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Imprisonment
Level: 9
School: Abjuration
Range: Short
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the Imprisonment spell is cast and the target creature is touched, it becomes entombed in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth in a state of suspended animation, conscious of its fate. The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists, rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned then he will reappear exactly where he was last standing. Dispel magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Freedom
Level: 9
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, all friendly creatures in the area are freed from spells and effects that restrict their movement or bind their minds. These effects include confusion, domination, entangle, feeblemindedness, hold, paralysis, petrification, sleep, slow, stun, and web. This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze and return any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes. If it is cast in an area where a creature was sealed with an Imprisonment spell, it will instantly free him and he will reappear exactly where he was standing when he was imprisoned.

Aid
Level: 2
School: Necromancy
Sphere: Combat, Necromantics
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, plus 1d8 additional hit points +1 per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 1d8+10). The Aid spell allows the recipient to temporarily have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Resist Fire and Cold
Level: 2
School: Alteration
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast upon a creature by a priest, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat and cold. The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flaming swords, fireballs, burning hands, or wands of frost. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient has all damage sustained by fire or cold reduced by 50%. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Call Lightning
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Weather 
Range: 80 ft.
Duration: 1 round/4 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 360-ft. radius 
Saving Throw: 1/2

The caster is able to call down one bolt of lightning per round. The spell has a duration of 1 round every 4 levels of the caster. Each bolt causes 2d6 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d6 points per level of the caster. Thus, an 8th-level caster will call down two bolts, each dealing 10d6 (2d6 + 8d6) points of damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies. The first enemy struck by the lightning will be the enemy targeted. After that, any enemy (but no allies) may be struck by the ensuing lightning storm.

-----------------------------------------------------------

(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent

Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: Special 

When the priest casts a Raise Dead spell, <PRO_HESHE> can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, halfling, elf, half-orc, or human; which has sometimes been known to cause a shock...

The person has but 1 Hit Point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Miscast Magic
Level: 3
School: Enchantment
Sphere: Chaos
Range: Long
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell negates

Miscast Magic causes spells cast by the affected creature to take on an effect different from what they intend, similar to what happens during a wild surge. There is a chance that the result will be beneficial to the spellcaster, but generally, the effects are undesirable. The target must make save vs. spell at -2 to negate the spell's effects. Those who fail the save will miscast any spells cast in the next round, and each round after the first must make another save to avoid miscasting for one further round. The effects of the spell last for 5 rounds, or until dispelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Neutralize Poison
Level: 4
School: Necromancy
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/+1 round level (max 5 rounds)
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell removes all toxins from the body, both natural and magical in nature. When this spell is cast upon a poisoned individual, it immediately neutralizes any poison. In addition, for the duration of the spell, the recipient is immune to any poison it is exposed to, and spells like Poison and Cloudkill won't affect the protected creature.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Raise Dead
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: Visual range of the caster

The person has but 1 Hit Point when raised and and is healed for 20 hit points shortly after.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Resurrection
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Like the 5th-level spell Raise Dead, Resurrection will return a character back to life. However, Resurrection also heals the character for 30 hit points shortly after so that they are ready for the adventuring life right away.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Storm of Vengeance

Level: 3
Range: 270 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

Casting this spell causes the earth to shake and the heavens to boil with blood and energy. All enemies of the caster are struck down by acidic rain, earthquakes, and lightning.

All enemies are struck by acidic, poisonous rain and lightning. The storm lasts for 3 rounds. Each round, the victims suffer 1d6 electrical damage, 1d6 fire damage, and 1d6 acid damage (Save vs. Spell for half damage). They also have a chance to be poisoned (Save vs. Death negates) in the first round.

-----------------------------------------------------------

(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: 30 ft.

	- Ring of Invisibility: Sandthief's Ring 
	
Held by a master Thief for the better part of a generation, this ring was put to bold use in the markets of Waterdeep. Working a crowd in broad daylight, the rogue would steal countless numbers of purses from nobles, replacing them with bags of sand so the theft would go unnoticed. His identity was never known, but the name "Sandthief" was cursed loudly in its stead. It is rumored he retired, and now lives among the nobles he used to rob.

-----------------------------------------------------------

	- Big Metal Unit and Components
	
This item is more so a novelty item rather than an actual item meant to be used. There are abuseable bugs with the item. Such as certain classes being able to wear it when they shouldn't, or getting multiple on-hit effects with the weapons.

This component should be installed before #5900 Initialise AI of SCS.

True Sight (Requires SCS)
(Divination)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 120 ft. in radius around the caster will be affected. Instantly and once per round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, magical Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The area of effect is roughly a 120-ft. radius around the caster. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell. This spell only affects enemies, thus it is unable to dispel invisibility from a party member. Finally, the spell also protects the caster from magical blindness for 3 rounds after it is cast.

Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, magical Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The area of effect is roughly a 120-ft. radius around the caster. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell.

///////////////////////////////BEGIN MONK CHANGES
/////////////////////////////////////////

	- Equipped Weapons

Monks have an unarmed weapon that the game engine assigns them. This weapon is swapped to when there is not a main hand weapon equipped. Allowing them to equip off-hand weapons, while still retaining the bonuses from the main hand.

Affects both Player and NPC Monks:

They are no longer able to dual wield an unarmed weapon and another weapon. They are however able to dual wield two weapons, or a single weapon. When a weapon is equipped in the off-hand and they are unarmed in their main hand, they will use their main hand as the deciding damage. This as a result will prevent them from being able to benefit from unarmed main hand/off-hand weapon usage.


	- Weapon Effects
	
In addition Monks will now receive +1 to their non-equipped weapon at level 5, and cumulatively at levels 9, 12, and 18. 

Attacks are now at double their normal APR, by having improved haste constantly without the speed and weapon attack speed bonus. At their normal 1 APR, they will attack at 2; at their first gain of .5 APR, they will attack at 3 APR, etc up to a cap of 10 at level 24. 

Their APR will no longer be improved by spells like Improved Haste, they will however benefit from the movement speed and attack speed bonus. Bonus +2 MS at level 1 is removed.

18> LoB Saves

	Normally for the Legacy of Bhaal difficulty, all non-party NPCs are suppose to receive a +5 bonus to their saving throws which this component allows. As LoB currently is, they receive a bonus as well as penalty which negates the bonus entirely. 
	
	This component prevents any player generated characters, player familiars, ally summons (player or friendly), or NPCs with a biography from receiving the bonus. Any hostile variations of the above aside from NPCs with biographies receive the bonus.
	
	Additional, AC now scales rather than being a flag -11 bonus:
	
		LEVEL   LoB LEVEL   BONUS AC   PAST CAP   TOTAL

	Use "C:CreateCreature('eyesnt01')" for debugging.
	
19> Enchanted Ranged

	All ranged weaponry will now grant the effect of their enchantment overall. This means that if a +3 bow is used with normal ammo, the +3 of the bow will be the determing factor of if the bow can hit the target. If the ammo exceeds the enchantment of bow, then the ammo will be the deciding factor. This makes it follow in line with the rest of the games enchantments.
